              For riders, if their trip gets canceled by the driver, then our app will dictate the refund policy.

            If driver cancels > 72 hours of scheduled departure time then no compensation from the driver or app. The app will help the rider find another ride if possible.
            
            If driver cancels between 24 to 72 hours of scheduled departure time then the money paid by the rider can be used towards future travels on the app as a credit.
            
            If driver cancels within 24 hours of scheduled departure time then the app will provide full refund and also arrange for another trip if available. App will also provide a credit equivalent to the cost of the trip to use in the future.
